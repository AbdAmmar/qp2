*Quantum Package* is an open-source programming environment for quantum
chemistry specially designed for wave function methods. Its main goal is the
development of determinant-driven selected configuration interaction (sCI)
methods and multi-reference second-order perturbation theory (PT2).

The determinant-driven framework allows the programmer to include any arbitrary
set of determinants in the reference space, hence providing greater
methodological freedoms. The sCI method implemented in *Quantum Package* is
based on the CIPSI (Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection
made Iteratively) algorithm which complements the variational sCI energy with a
PT2 correction.  Additional external plugins have been recently added to
perform calculations with multireference coupled cluster theory and
range-separated density-functional theory.
